## Newsletters

### Technical
These are a nice assortment of what is going on in AI and Machine Learning around the world. 

#### [Amplify: Projects to Know](https://projectstoknow.amplifypartners.com/ml-and-data)
Each week it provides three papers, three projects and three articles around ML & data. In general it gives some of the best overviews of what is happening 

#### [Artificial Intelligence Weekly](http://aiweekly.co)
A nicely presented minimal curated list of articles, that are not overly technical about AI and the effects it can have on society.

#### [Analytics Engineering Roundup](http://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/)
By Tristan Handy, the creator of DBT, this newsletter is one of my favourites. It covers all things data with small personal comments here and there. Would highly recommend.

#### [Data Science Weekly](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=71a2b2a38789d4d25b738462f&id=b63d6b814f)
Despite the horrific layout this newsletter is a great curated list of articles, videos and training resources around the topic of DS. It also seems to be slightly ahead of the curve in regards to picking up articles before other newsletters.

#### [Data Exilir](https://dataelixir.com/)
Similar to the [Insert Buzzword] Weekly newsletters it composes a number of articles which cover topics surrounding AI and DS. They often overlap a lot but you can find the occassional gem in one that is not picked up by the others.

#### [Hacker Newsletter](https://www.hackernewsletter.com/)
Collection of the top performing articles on Hacker News. Not every week but most weeks they have a data section which has some pretty cool stuff in it. Also good for seing what 

#### [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning)
As anyone who has worked with me will know. I am a big fan of reddit. And this subreddit is one of my favourites. It covers the entire spectrum of ML,AI and DS. Plenty of learning resources and despite a large proportion of the community being overly up themselves there are an abundance of people willing to help.

### Non Technical
These generally aren't so technically orientated but are good fun and are often quite related to tech and AI.

#### [Tim Harford](http://timharford.com/)
I am a big fan of this guy. I follow a number of his podcasts and this newsletter is from his column at the financial times. He is an economist but will delve into all sorts of topics from a logical stand point and has some great insights.

#### [Exponential View](http://www.exponentialview.co/)
__Warning__ this has become a weekly behemoth that takes up the majority of my week when I try to read all of it. What used to be a nice collection of articles has now spiralled into a trove of opinions, insights, podcasts and the original articles. Despite this I would really recommend it as there is no need to delve into the entirity of it and the article selection is top drawer.

#### [Ben Thompson: Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/)
I love this one so much so that it has become one of my must reads since I subscribed. It covers the recent developments in tech from an experienced angle and with simple and digestable insights.

#### [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter)
From a guy who used to work at a16z who covers the changing landscape in tech from a fairly unique perspective. Similarish to stratechery.

His podcast Another Podcast is my favourite about atm.

#### [Thoughts in Between](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thoughts-in-between-exploring-how-technology-collides/id1547838601)
This guy runs an incubator of sorts and has some really great thoughts more on the societal and political side of things. Well worth a read.

#### [Julie Zhuo: The Looking Glass](http://juliezhuo.com/design/mailinglist.html)

#### [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)
This is not for the feint hearted. Wait But Why is a sporadic mammoth of in depth analysis into a vast array of topics from AI to space travel to how to combat procrastination. He has this methodology of building from the trunk. So starting from the very basics and building branch by branch to the point that we are at today and where it can go in the future. I end up recommending his series on Elon Musk and AI to almost everyone. 

#### [The Download](https://www.technologyreview.com/collection/the-download/)
An email a few times a week with brief summaries of what is going on in the world of science and tech. Nice to see what is going on outside the data bubble.

## Youtube
Anyone who has the pleasure/misfortune of working with me will know that I am a big advocate of Youtube. There are a number of channels which are a great resource for both technical and non technical alike.

#### [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher)
Really good coverage of recent papers and developments in AI and ML. The best place for gaining understanding of recent innovations IMO.

#### [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz)
As the title might suggest this channel covers recent academic developments in AI and ML. But they break it down into a quick and easily digestable format with a summary of the potential implications.

#### [3 Blue One Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
This channel does some of the best explanations of processes on the internet. Their video on Blockchain is the best out there.

#### [Cold Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/user/coldfustion)
A very high level coverage of what is happening in tech and AI. Really well editted.

## Podcasts

#### [Another Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/another-podcast/id1535359773)
My favourite podcast by some margin. Goes over the trends in tech and society from a fairly unique approach. They don't tend to come to too many conclusions but more talk around the topic which I really appreciate.

#### [Acquired Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7Fj0XEuUQLUqoMZQdsLXqp?si=0bdc04cbdd7c4ee1)
Mammoth episodes but well worth the time. Goes in depth in the story and methods of hugely successful companies.

#### [The Data Exchange](https://open.spotify.com/show/65oFWYoomwT8mLcdGkUGd0?si=d3b4b237c8d44073)
Has some really great guests from around the data space. Really good overviews of what is going on and how people are trying to improve the data experience.
