## Newsletters

### Technical
These are a nice assortment of what is going on in AI and Machine Learning around the world. 

#### [Artificial Intelligence Weekly](http://aiweekly.co)
A nicely presented minimal curated list of articles, that are not overly technical about AI and the effects it can have on society.

#### [Data Science Weekly](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=71a2b2a38789d4d25b738462f&id=b63d6b814f)
Despite the horrific layout this newsletter is a great curated list of articles, videos and training resources around the topic of DS. It also seems to be slightly ahead of the curve in regards to picking up articles before other newsletters.

#### [Data Machina](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/datamachina)
I only subscribed to this one recently but it seems to be one of the best technical newsletters I have come across. It covers everything from Deep Learning to IoT to Blockchain and gives a few articles for each topic.

#### [Data Exilir](https://dataelixir.com/)
Similar to the [Insert Buzzword] Weekly newsletters it composes a number of articles which cover topics surrounding AI and DS. They often overlap a lot but you can find the occassional gem in one that is not picked up by the others.

#### [Hacker Newsletter](https://www.hackernewsletter.com/)
Collection of the top performing articles on Hacker News. Not every week but most weeks they have a data section which has some pretty cool stuff in it. Also good for seing what 

#### [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning)
As anyone who has worked with me will know. I am a big fan of reddit. And this subreddit is one of my favourites. It covers the entire spectrum of ML,AI and DS. Plenty of learning resources and despite a large proportion of the community being overly up themselves there are an abundance of people willing to help.

#### [Better Dev](https://betterdev.link/)
This is very technical, aimed more at software developers than DS, but occassionally comes up with some interesting pieces that are more DS inclined and it is always interesting to see what is happening in the hardcore tech side.

### Non Technical
These generally aren't so technically orientated but are good fun and are often quite related to tech and AI.

#### [Morning Brew](morningbrew.com/?kid=9f4cf9)
Despite not investing in anything I do follow Morning Brew. It gives you a nice succinct overview of what is happening, with an emphasis on investment and US focus. However, the analysis is clear and is useful to keep up with current affairs with an added level of understanding. 

#### [Tim Harford](http://timharford.com/)
I am a big fan of this guy. I follow a number of his podcasts and this newsletter is from his column at the financial times. He is an economist but will delve into all sorts of topics from a logical stand point and has some great insights.

#### [Exponential View](http://www.exponentialview.co/)
__Warning__ this has become a weekly behemoth that takes up the majority of my week when I try to read all of it. What used to be a nice collection of articles has now spiralled into a trove of opinions, insights, podcasts and the original articles. Despite this I would really recommend it as there is no need to delve into the entirity of it and the article selection is top drawer.

#### [Ben Thompson: Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/)
I love this one so much so that it has become one of my must reads since I subscribed. It covers the recent developments in tech from an experienced angle and with simple and digestable insights.

#### [Kevin Rose: The Journal](https://www.kevinrose.com/newsletter)

#### [Julie Zhuo: The Looking Glass](http://juliezhuo.com/design/mailinglist.html)

#### [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)
This is not for the feint hearted. Wait But Why is a sporadic mammoth of in depth analysis into a vast array of topics from AI to space travel to how to combat procrastination. He has this methodology of building from the trunk. So starting from the very basics and building branch by branch to the point that we are at today and where it can go in the future. I end up recommending his series on Elon Musk and AI to almost everyone. 

## Youtube
Anyone who has the pleasure/misfortune of working with me will know that I am a big advocate of Youtube. There are a number of channels which are a great resource for both technical and non technical alike.

#### [Siraj](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)
Siraj must be one of the most famous AI/ML practitioners on Youtube. He has great tutorials from attempting Kaggle challenges to the best ways to build your own Deep Learning computers. __Warning__ he attempts to rap sometimes.

#### [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz)
As the title might suggest this channel covers recent academic developments in AI and ML. But they break it down into a quick and easily digestable format with a summary of the potential implications.

#### [3 Blue One Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
This channel does some of the best explanations of processes on the internet. Their video on Blockchain is the best out there.

#### [Cold Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/user/coldfustion)
A very high level coverage of what is happening in tech and AI. Really well editted.
