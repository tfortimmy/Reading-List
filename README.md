## Newsletters

### AI

These are a nice assortment of what is going on in AI and Machine Learning around the world. 

#### [Aritificial Intelligence Weekly](http://aiweekly.co)
A nicely presented minimal curated list of articles, that are not overly technical about AI and the effects it can have on society.

#### [Data Science Weekly](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=71a2b2a38789d4d25b738462f&id=b63d6b814f)
Despite the horrific layout this newsletter is a great curated list of articles, videos and training resources around the topic of DS. It also seems to be slightly ahead of the curve in regards to picking up articles before other newsletters.

#### [Data Machina](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/datamachina)
I only subscribed to this one recently but it seems to be one of the best technical newsletters I have come across. It covers everything from Deep Learning to IoT to Blockchain and gives a few articles for each topic.

#### [Data Exilir](https://dataelixir.com/)
Similar to the [Insert Buzzword] Weekly newsletters it composes a number of articles which cover topics surrounding AI and DS. They often overlap a lot but you can find the occassional gem in one that is not picked up by the others.

#### [Hacker Newsletter](https://www.hackernewsletter.com/)
Collection of the top performing articles on Hacker News. Not every week but most weeks they have a data section which has some pretty cool stuff in it. Also good for seing what 

#### [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning)
As anyone who has worked with me will know. I am a big fan of reddit. And this subreddit is one of my favourites. It covers the entire spectrum of ML,AI and DS. Plenty of learning resources and despite a large proportion of the community being overly up themselves there are an abundance of people willing to help.




### Other Stuff
These generally aren't so technically orientated but are good fun and are often quite related to tech and AI.

#### [Morning Brew](morningbrew.com/?kid=9f4cf9)
Despite not investing in anything I do follow a few Morning Brew gives you a nice succinct overview of what is happening, with an emphasis on investment and US focus. However, the analysis is clear and is useful to keep up with current affairs with an added level of understanding. 

#### [Better Dev](https://betterdev.link/)
This is very technical, aimed more at software developers than DS, but occassionally comes up with some interesting pieces that are more DS inclined and it is always interesting to see what is happening in the hardcore tech side.

#### [Tim Harford](http://timharford.com/)
I am a big fan of this guy. I follow a number of his podcasts and this newsletter is 

#### [Exponential View](http://www.exponentialview.co/)
Warning this has become a weekly behemoth that 

#### [Ben Thompson: Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/)

#### [Kevin Rose: The Journal](https://www.kevinrose.com/newsletter)

#### [Julie Zhuo: The Looking Glass](http://juliezhuo.com/design/mailinglist.html)

#### [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)
This is not for the feint hearted. Wait But Why is a sporadic mammoth
